MARCO: a smart ball for the blind


Notes:
MARCO_lib is a custom sensor fusion library. Make sure to feed in angles in radians to the FusionPRY function. Its designed to run as fast as possible to help minimize errors and drift. Check out the example sketch which shows how to use the library to get angle absolute orientation.
